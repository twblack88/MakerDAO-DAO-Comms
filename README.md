# MakerDAO-DAO-Comms
Content, Communications, Updates, &amp; coordination for governance communications within MakerDAO

Our current mandate lives in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17NuTL_B4GmwrOvurg9an4_vWbBuHeJCzfcN_XX1tFfU/edit?usp=sharing). We're working a few topics at once, and trying to solve a difficult problem. If you have any interest in participating, ghelping the DAO communicate to itself and the external community, ping me on [rocketchat](https://chat.makerdao.com/channel/community-development).
