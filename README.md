# MakerDAO-DAO-Comms
Content, Communications, Updates, &amp; coordination for Governance communications within MakerDAO

Our current mandate lives in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17NuTL_B4GmwrOvurg9an4_vWbBuHeJCzfcN_XX1tFfU/edit?usp=sharing). We're working a few topics at once, and trying to solve a difficult problem (giving a voice to a DAO, helping the public communicate *TO* and *FROM* the DAO). If you have any interest in participating, helping the DAO communicate to itself and the external community, ping me on [rocketchat](https://chat.makerdao.com/direct/tim_black).
